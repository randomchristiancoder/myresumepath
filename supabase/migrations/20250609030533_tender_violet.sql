/*
  # Fix infinite recursion in user_roles RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - The existing admin policies for user_roles table create infinite recursion
    - Policies are checking user_roles table within user_roles policies
    - This creates a circular dependency when Supabase evaluates the policies

  2. Solution
    - Drop the problematic admin policies that cause recursion
    - Create simpler, non-recursive policies
    - Use auth.uid() directly instead of checking user_roles within user_roles policies
    - Implement admin checks at the application level instead of database level for this table

  3. Changes
    - Remove recursive admin policies
    - Keep simple user-based policies that don't cause recursion
    - Ensure users can still read their own roles

-- Drop the problematic policies that cause infinite recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage roles" ON user_roles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can read all roles" ON user_roles;

-- Keep the simple policy that allows users to read their own roles (no recursion)
-- This policy is already correct and doesn't cause recursion
-- DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own roles" ON user_roles;
-- CREATE POLICY "Users can read own roles"
--   ON user_roles
--   FOR SELECT
--   TO authenticated
--   USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create a simple policy for users to manage their own roles (if needed)
-- This is safer than the recursive admin policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own roles"
  ON user_roles
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create a simple policy for inserting roles
-- Admin functionality will be handled at the application level
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert roles"
  ON user_roles
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Create a simple policy for deleting roles
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own roles"
  ON user_roles
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
